# Notes from the beginning of lab
# import the different classes we made
# return the position instead of printing the position

# add a gui and controller to adjust the controller
    # are we going to have do a bunch of stuff

# ten times the time constant portportional control
    # will just have to do a P control 
    # 50 to 100 calls at a time
# .1 second time response 

# set point, where do we want to be 
# belonging to controller class
# self.set_point

# give the controllers constructor a callable
# give the functon to the controller option so it can use the function varible to read it in the class and functions

# know hwere the encoder is
# have the function callable so the controller could work for other things 

# import motor driver 
# control algorithim several times a second
